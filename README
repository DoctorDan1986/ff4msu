Final Fantasy IV, MSU Edition
=============================

This romhack modifies Final Fantasy IV/II (US and JP) to support rendered
cutscenes (and maybe in the future, orchestral soundtracks) from the
PSX/DS/PSP ports on the SNES, through byuu's MSU1 extension for the SNES[1].

Currently the Introductory sequence (before the main menu) and the opening
cutscene are implemented.

The code is held very general, as to provide a blueprint for similar projects
for other games.

The code is written in the "snes-cpu" syntax for byuu's BASS-Assembler[2].
